HGV TRAINING NETWORK FAQ

Is there a shortage of HGV drivers in the UK?
The current driver shortage is now sitting at around the 100,000 mark. This is now reaching a real crisis point as the demand for distribution keeps on increasing year on year.
The industry is currently losing nearly 4000 drivers a year to retirement, as the average age of an existing lorry driver is 53 years of age.
The demand for drivers has also increased by nearly 40000 drivers during the Covid19 pandemic and Brexit.

Why is there a driver shortage?
The average age of a HGV driver is 53 years old and only 2% of drivers are under the age of 25.
That means with the amount of people retiring, there isn’t enough drivers to fully sustain the industry and to continue delivering high quality services. If something isn’t done to try and attract more drivers, the industry shortage will have a huge and long-lasting impact on the goods that are being delivered up and down the UK.
The haulage industry has also blamed the driver shortfall on a post-Brexit exodus of European drivers. The Road Haulage Association estimates that up to 20,000 HGV drivers from the EU left during the Brexit process.
It is also estimated that the extra demand for more drivers during the Covid19 pandemic has increased the demand for HGV drivers by an extra 20,000 as more and more products are being delivered to residential addresses.

Is there a shortage of HGV Drivers?

There is currently a substantial shortage and hence a huge demand for HGV and LGV drivers across the country as the industry looks to replace drivers who are approaching retirement. Estimates range from 80,000 to 100,000 drivers that are desperately needed right now.
The increase in demand for distribution during the pandemic has also contributed to the number of drivers required. With the average age of lorry drivers currently sitting at 53 years old, we are losing nearly 4,000 drivers a year to retirement.

What is the difference between HGV and LGV?
HGV stands for “heavy goods vehicle”, and LGV stands for “large goods vehicle” – not “light goods vehicle”, as some mistakenly believe. This means that, under UK and European law, an HGV licence and an LGV licence are fundamentally the same thing. They cover all commercial lorries featuring a gross combination mass of over 3500kg, which includes fridge trucks, box vans, Luton vans, flat beds, tippers and more.

Do you arrange everything for me?
We arrange everything for you: from your first medical and the provisional application stage, to arranging the theory and practical parts of your test.  If you require the licence as part of your career, we will even help you obtain your driver’s CPC qualification.  Once you are qualified, we can even help you arrange interviews so you can get your first job as a professional driver.
We handle everything. You can even start the driving lessons now and pay for it later.

What are the benefits of of becoming a HGV Driver?

Choosing a career is something most people do at some stage in their lives. Some even change careers a few times throughout their working lifetime. The logistics industry is one of the most important sectors worldwide, ensuring goods arrive safely at destinations within the UK and beyond. This helps ensure manufacturing continues and supermarket shelves remain stocked, to name but two key areas. If you want to become an HGV driver, you’ll need to undergo HGV training to gain the relevant licence. But is it worth it? Here are some of the benefits if this is a route you’re considering:
* The Abundance of Work and Jobs
If you acquire your HGV licence, an abundance of work and jobs will become available to you, not least because, as noted, HGV drivers are in huge demand right now. Learning to drive these vehicles is a good career choice for anyone looking to capitalise on future demand, especially in the logistics industry.
* Excellent Salary
Drivers have a responsibility to deliver their goods safely and punctually. You can expect to earn a rewarding salary if you meet the criteria. Drivers typically earn between £25,000 and £40,000 at entry-level, with wages rising to £55,000 a year or more based on experience, distances driven and the type of goods they are carrying.
* Job Security
Because the demand for drivers is so high at the moment, and because logistics is an industry that will always be necessary, aspiring HGV drivers can expect outstanding job security in their new roles. With shortfalls throughout the industry, there will also be plenty of opportunities to move between companies for career advancement. In short, at present and for the foreseeable future, the benefits of working in logistics and other areas lie mainly with the driver rather than the employer.
* Transferable Skills
Even if you decide in a couple of years that this is not the career for you, an HGV licence opens plenty of doors to future roles within logistics and other industries. With the right training, you can acquire a range of highly transferable skills, from driving large vehicles to organisational skills, spatial awareness, approachability and more. You’re likely to be much in demand in an increasingly competitive jobs market.


What does the company do?

At HGV Training Network, your dream career is now within your reach. We offer high-standard yet affordable HGV training courses that help you land rewarding, well-paid employment. We also offer a ‘Train Now, Pay Later’ program whether you’re new to the industry or working your way up the ranks of your career.
Large goods vehicle (LGV) drivers, also known as HGV drivers, transport and deliver goods and raw materials across the UK and overseas. They move everything from foodstuffs to fuel. You can earn great money doing something you love, with the average salary in some areas of the UK being as high as £55,000 per year.
This is not your standard 9-5 job. With flexible hours and a limit to how many hours you have to work, there are not many better industries to be in. If you enjoy working by yourself, want a job that makes use of your driving skills, has huge earning potential, and one that can take you all over the country, this career could be for you.

How to Get Your HGV Licence?
You must be at least 18 years old and have a full car driver’s licence. You can then apply for your HGV provisional licence. The type of licence you need depends on the size and type of vehicle you want to drive. The D2 and D4 forms are available from us.
You then need HGV driving lessons to prepare for taking the road test by the DVSA.
Once you have passed, you will complete your Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) exam. That covers four areas:
* Ability to load / unload the vehicle
* Securing loads
* Vehicle checks
* Vehicle security checks

Will I be eligible for finance? How does the Finance decision work?

Your application will be assessed based on eligibility, credit history and affordability and Deko will let you know the outcome in just a few seconds. It’s important to know that when applying for finance a credit check is made which is recorded on your credit file.
The loan amount, loan term and interest rate the lender is willing to offer you will be decided based on these checks and the lender’s decisioning policies.
Once approved, Deko will provide you with full details about your lender, including how to contact them. You then just need to digitally sign your credit agreement, pay your deposit and wait for your order to arrive.
In a few cases, your application may be referred to your lender for manual assessment and you’ll be notified by email of the credit decision within 24 hours. If you’re not approved for finance, it could be for a variety of reasons and the lender will be able to give you more information.

Can I cancel my booking?

There is a 14-day cooling off period where you can withdraw from the credit agreement after signing your documents. If you wish to do this, please contact us (your retailer) directly. We can cancel the application on your behalf. There is no need to contact Deko or your lender.
A payment plan does not affect our standard refund and returns policy. Just contact us and we’ll cancel your application, and the lender will refund your deposit and let you know if you have any balance to repay.

If I pay on finance what is the minimum deposit?

£40

If I pay on finance when do the payments come out?

Your first Direct Debit payment will be taken about a month after the first part of your course is booked in. This will show on your statement as a payment to your lender. You have the right to repay all or part of the loan early at any time.
